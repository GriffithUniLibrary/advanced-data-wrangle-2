**Windows**: double-click on the `openrefine.exe` file. Java services will start automatically on your machine, and OpenRefine will open in your browser. Be sure to use either Chrome or Firefox, as OpenRefine does not play well with Microsoft Edge or Safari.

**Mac**: OpenRefine can be launched from your Applications folder.

**Linux**: navigate to your OpenRefine directory in the command line and enter `./refine`.

Once OpenRefine is launched in your browser, the home screen displays options to `Create Project`, `Open Project`, or `Import Project`. 

Select `Create a project`.

**If launch fails**

If OpenRefine does not automatically open within your browser after launch, point your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:3333/` or `http://localhost:3333` to launch the program.{% endcapture %}

- If all looks fine, click  `Create Project`.{% endcapture %}

The original dataset presents details of numbers of sharks caught in the Shark Control program by species, date of capture and location and other variables. This version of the dataset has ten variables.  Take a look at each variable in the columns presented.

Let's now try to add a few more variables to the dataset.
